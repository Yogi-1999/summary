      " [15] The move reduced the country's industrial production and its GDP growth rate. [16]\n",
      "Initially, the move received support from several bankers as well as from some international commentators. He later denied making the comments. [1] This limit was increased to ₹24,000 per week from 14 November 2016. [40][41] Limits on cash withdrawals from Current accounts/ Cash credit accounts/ Overdraft accounts were withdrawn later. [12] Commentators concluded that the government failed in its aim of purging black money from the economy. [68][69] After the demonetisation, there was a spike in donations in the form of the demonetised banknotes in temples. [74][75]\n",
      "After demonetisation, there was an increase in the number of counterfeit ₹100 and ₹50 banknotes. [76] There has been no significant change in the number of counterfeit banknotes detected. [77] Additionally, after demonetisation, only 0.0035% of the ₹1,000 banknotes were found to be counterfeit. If adjusted for it, the increase in tax collection was modest. [82]\n",
      "The push for digital payments was one of the stated intentions of demonetisation. [83] After return of the cash, the growth in digital payment had been modest. [76] The currency-to-GDP ratio was only marginally lower compared to levels before  demonetisation. [12] The volume of banknotes in the market increased by 2.1%. [95][96] There was a decrease in the terror activities in Jammu and Kashmir. [7][8][99][100] The ATMs were short of cash for months after demonetisation. [115]\n",
      "There was a reduction in industrial output as industries were hit by the cash shortage. [126][127] Some farmers dumped their produce in protest against the government. [141] This drop was attributed to demonetisation by economists. [158]\n",
      "The banks incurred the cost in collection, storage and movement of banknotes across the country as well as in re-calibrating the ATMs. [178] Similar PILs were also filed in the Supreme Court of India. [181] As a result, many people were left stranded with demonetised banknotes. [184]\n",
      "Indian-American economist Jagdish Bhagwati praised the demonetisation. [194] Steve Forbes described the move as 'Sickening And Immoral'. \"[14]\n",
      "The decision met with mixed initial reactions. [197] Infosys founder N. R. Narayana Murthy praised the move. [203] Chief Minister of Bihar Nitish Kumar supported the move. [222] It said that it was not just the poor that suffered, but the manufacturing sector was impacted too. [233][234]\n",
      "Strikes were organised across India. [241]\n",
      "By and large, initial international response was positive which saw the move as a bold crackdown on corruption. [263][260] The BJP and its allies lost to the INC in Punjab. [264][265]\n"
